# More about me

According to my friends, I have always had an eye for detail. Adding to this my curiosity about futurology and new technologies, it's no wonder when I took part in a software testing marathon one winter evening, I became more interested in development opportunities in this field. Therefore I decided to take an intensive "Software Tester" course.  I like to gain new knowledge and every day I take steps in this direction to become a full-fledged software tester.
